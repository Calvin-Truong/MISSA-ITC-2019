# MISSA-ITC-2019
Background Information
Bazinga’s! (www.bazingas.com) was founded in 1998 as an online retailer, initially selling small electronic
devices to consumers over the Internet. The company’s early website design was nothing more than
simple hyperlinked text, since Internet technologies had not evolved to support rich content. Bazinga’s!
was known for its sense of humor and frequently posted random funny sayings at the bottom of its web
pages for user amusement. By the end of 2005 Bazinga’s! had diversified its product inventory to include
almost anything which could be sold online that was not perishable. The company had transitioned to
stocking/fulfilling orders via regional distribution centers. Bazinga’s! had also established an online
marketplace and payment/order fulfillment process for individual merchants to sell their products. The
company has continued to innovate and grow quickly and it is now considered the most valuable publicly
traded company with a market capitalization of more than $1 trillion. Bazinga’s! founder, Jayne Brown,
was recently named the wealthiest person on the Forbes 400 Wealthiest People’s List. Forbes Publisher,
Steve Forbes commented, “For the first time ever, a woman leads this prestigious list and thus, a
significant glass ceiling has been broken!”
Based on the popular adoption of Bazinga’s! Web Services (BWS) platform the company developed and
introduced a cryptocurrency (B-Coin) and supporting blockchain as a service (BAAS). Bazinga’s!
determined this service offering could help to decrease operating costs and speed up e-commerce
transactions by keeping financial transactions within the company’s operations. Additionally, emerging
markets, such as the cannabis industry, don’t have access to the financial system because cannabis is
still considered illegal under Federal Laws. The B-Coin and BAAS offerings quickly became popular with
regular Bazinga’s! merchants and a de-facto standard of the cannabis industry capturing more than 90
percent of online business.
Recently Bazinga’s! corporate offices and regional data centers were raided by the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for illegal drug trafficking and money
laundering. A Columbian drug cartel had been detected by the DEA using B-Coin and BAAS for
conducting illegal drug sales. Product listings on Bazinga’s! had been identified as using stuffed animals
containing illegal drugs for distribution. No stuffed animals containing illegal drugs ever entered
Bazinga’s! warehouses, but the Columbian drug cartel made an order fulfilling error to a regular
Bazinga’s! customer who thought they were ordering a regular stuffed animal. The customer contacted
the DEA when they discovered the illegal drugs in their shipment. Additionally, the FBI had detected an
organized crime family had repurposed B-Coin as a platform for laundering millions of dollars.
Problem Statement
Due to the type and level of criminal activity, the DEA and FBI went to Federal Court and obtained an
injunction requiring Bazinga’s! to immediately cease and desist from offering B-Coin and BAAS until they
could prove to the Federal Court the company had suitable controls in place to prohibit repurposing of BCoin and BAAS for major criminal activities. The injunction put Bazinga’s! under Federal Court

supervision and halted a growing part of their business. The cannabis industry’s e-commerce activity was
severely impaired since B-Coin and BAAS had become a popular platform for supporting the cannabis
supply chain. Bazinga’s! Legal Department was attempting to get the injunction lifted, but the Senior
Leadership Team was not optimistic about the outcome.
The impact of the injunction was so severe that Bazinga’s market capitalization was reduced by 15
percent in one day of trading and the SEC ordered trading in Bazinga’s! stock to be suspended until
controls over the B-Coin and BAAS platform could be clarified. The suspension in stock trading caused
Jayne Brown to be summoned to a meeting of the Board of Directors to discuss the trading suspension
and what her plan going forward would be to get the suspension lifted. The Board indicated the
shareholders are starting to get impatient with the “roller coaster ride” of past technology problems and
would like to see more stability with Bazinga’s! technology innovations going forward. Jayne Brown
responded to the Board by indicating she’s solved problems successfully in the past and in order to
innovate you have to be willing to take risks and considering the market value of Bazinga’s! continues to
grow the investors appear to accept these types of risks.
Jayne Brown invited the SVP of Product/Services Development, SVP of Legal Affairs and the CIO to a
working lunch where they discussed the current situations and she raised the following issues:
1. Our design and plans for B-Coin and BAAS seemed so well thought out. It was clear we had
identified an emerging market (cannabis industry) that was not being served and thought we had
another big win on our hands. How could we not anticipate that a new innovative platform could
be repurposed to support criminal activities? Could our regular e-commerce platform have the
same potential to be used to support criminal activities?
2. Given the issues and injunction we are faced with B-Coin and BAAS, should we consider entering
into a settlement agreement with the Federal Court where we would agree to never offer a ecommerce service which could be repurposed to support criminal activity? Is there a practical
Bazinga’s! could provide this assurance to the Federal Court?
3. If we decide to keep B-Coin and BAAS as a market offering, what are the best practices and
controls for offering this technology to avoid it being repurposed to support criminal activities?
Should we extend these best practices and controls to all Bazinga’s! e-commerce platforms?
At the conclusion of lunch Jayne Brown, the SVP of Product/Services Development, the SVP of Legal
Affairs and the CIO agreed to develop a request for information (RFI) to solicit ideas and hypothesis on
how to address the above issues from qualified consulting firms to map out a plan to review the eCommerce services offerings (B-Coin, BAAS and other Bazinga’s! e-commerce services) and to
determine the feasibility of implementing an acceptable set of business controls.
Request for Information Terms and Conditions
Bazinga’s! is requesting RFIs from qualified consulting teams to determine how to obtain consulting
services to assist with recommending business controls for preventing criminal abuse of Bazinga’s! BCoin, BAAS and e-Commerce platforms. In order to evaluate RFIs and to rank consulting teams Jayne
Brown, the SVP of Product/Services Development, the SVP of Legal Affairs and the CIO have formed a
Consultant Selection Committee composed of prominent IT executives from industry. The Consultant
Selection Committee will review all RFIs and concepts submitted and rank the consulting teams based on
RFIs and oral presentations/interviews. The request for information should describe ideas and

approaches for how an acceptable set of business controls might work and how they might be
implemented.
It is recommended each RFI submitted contain at a minimum the following information:
1. Background Observations – The consultants’ interpretation and understanding of Bazinga’s!
problem (problem statement) and proposed assignment. Identify any special issues the
consulting team believes the proposed consulting assignment should address as well as any
potential risks.
2. Scope and Objectives – What components of B-Coin, BAAS and Bazinga’s! e-Commerce
process will be addressed by the business controls? Are different components of B-Coin, BAAS
and Bazinga’s! e-Commerce process more critical and contain more risk of criminal abuse than
others?
3. Proposed Business Controls and Implementation Plan – What types of business controls
should be deployed and in which components of B-Coin, BAAS and Bazinga’s! e-Commerce
process would these controls be implemented? A high-level outline of the implementation plan
steps (not too much detail) which will be completed by Bazinga’s! personnel and consultants
together to deploy the business controls.
4. Proposed Consulting Team – Present the consultants to be assigned, identify their roles in the
project and provide information on their past experiences as it relates to completing the
consulting assignment.
5. Timetable and Cost – What is the schedule for implementing the business controls, how long will
it take to complete and what might the implementation project cost? Bazinga’s! is only interested
in a very general estimate for cost and schedule, specific detail is not required at this point in
time.
6. Benefits to Bazinga’s! – What business benefits (value) will Bazinga’s! receive in exchange for
the fees spent to implement these business controls?
Care should be taken with preparing the contents of the written RFI since it will be relied upon as part of
future final contract between Bazinga’s! and the selected consulting team. All RFIs submitted become
the property of Bazinga’s! and the company will not be responsible for any costs associated for
preparation of RFIs or for attending the oral presentation/interview.
Oral Presentation and Interview
The SVP of Product/Services Development, SVP of Legal Affairs and CIO have been assigned by the
Board of Directors to sit in on the oral presentations. These executives are busy people and thus do not
have a tolerance for meetings longer than 30 minutes. Therefore, Consulting Teams will be given 20
minutes to deliver their presentations and then the Consultant Selection Committee will limit questions
and answers to 10 minutes. In order for the Consultant Selection Committee to properly understand and
evaluate your proposal, it will be very important for the entire oral presentation to be completed within the
20 minute presentation period.
